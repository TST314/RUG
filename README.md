# RUG
Random User Generator

Just a fun little program I made when I got bored. I don't really think this can be used maliciously because it just makes a file. 
Wanted to see if I could make a belivable generator for people like how there is online. 


Note: This was one of the first things projects I did in Python and only recently (as of the last year) has it been uploaded to Github. Such is the reason this looks very basic and "rugged" ish. I had lots of fun with making this, but I understand how the code looks very "ugly" and unmanagable. 

Later it would be really cool to make an updated version of this with all the new things I have learned since this was first written. :D

Enjoy!
